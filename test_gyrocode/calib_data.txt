Sensor readings with offsets:	13	-5	16378	1	1	0
Your offsets:	-787	-279	1317	90	-24	32

Data is printed as: acelX acelY acelZ giroX giroY giroZ
Check that your sensor readings are close to 0 0 16384 0 0 0
If calibration was succesful write down your offsets so you can set them in your projects using something similar to mpu.setXAccelOffset(youroffset)
